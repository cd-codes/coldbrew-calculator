# coldbrew-calculator

This project is a cold brew calculator that will take in a user's preferences for how many days they would like to drink
a batch of cold brew and what glass size they prefer to calculate the ratio of coffee to water they need to brew.

Since this project is in progress, the goal will be to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to produce a calculator with a responsive layout.
