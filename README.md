This project features a responsive layout designed first in **Figma**, using both **CSS Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** to position the elements in either a landscape orientation or a mobile-friendly vertical view.

**JavaScript** is used to change the visible card so that users can select options to input their preferences and see the calculated results.
